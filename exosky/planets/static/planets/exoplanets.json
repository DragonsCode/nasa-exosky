These can be explained with a Jovian planet. However, because of the planet's short distance to the star, its density has to be more then 20 times that of Jupiter. The planet is most likely a remnant of a binary star which avoided complete destruction. The chemical composition, pressure and dimensions of the planet indicate that it is crystallized, or in other words, a very big diamond (Bailes et al 2011)."}, {"star_name": "PSR J2322-2650", "planet_name": "PSR J2322-2650 b", "mass": "0.79490", "coordinates": {"x": 0.008855317494719224, "y": -0.002372775171431208, "z": -0.00447138569724859}, "distance": 47440950.0, "right_ascension": "23 22 35", "declination": "-26 50 58", "description": "This planet was discovered by Spiewak et al. 2018.
